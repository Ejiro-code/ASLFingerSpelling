This Project was intended to serve as a front-end medium for a classifier I built to distinguish between different fingerspellings in ASL (American Sign Language)

The model is currently not present within the repository (file size restrictions) but I will provide an external link for download at a future date.

Please note that at its current state, the app may only display a blank screen if the user does not possess a webcam.
